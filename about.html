        <!-- TESTO EPICO -->
        <p>
            We are left-handers. People who use their left-hand, left-foot, and supposedly the right brain.
            We create, we discover environments were people cannot reach. We are part of something greater.
            <br><br>
            We thrive through chaos and destruction and yet we survive and even better we scared people cause of out magic powers.
            They burned us, yet we are still here as an army of 10%.
