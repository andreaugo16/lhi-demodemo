        <p>
            What do you know about left-hand people? I'll tell you what: nothing.
            The origin of us is quite unique and nobody knows what the true beginning is.
            There are traces of left-handed people in the ancient ages of humankind,
            but also in the realm of the animal kingdom.
            <br><br>
            There is a big lore of left-handed people — famous painters like 
            Leonardo Da Vinci, American presidents, Napoleon,
            and others who mastered the left-hand and became unique and unstoppable
            against the right-handed majority.
